Computing Distance Matrix
While merging two clusters we check the distance between two every pair of clusters and merge the pair with the least distance/most similarity. But the question is how is that distance determined. There are different ways of defining Inter Cluster distance/similarity. Some of them are:

Min Distance: Find the minimum distance between any two points of the cluster.
Max Distance: Find the maximum distance between any two points of the cluster.
Group Average: Find the average distance between every two points of the clusters.
Ward's Method: The similarity of two clusters is based on the increase in squared error when two clusters are merged.
